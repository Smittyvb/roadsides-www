<h1>Everyone Loves Roadside Attractions!</h1>

<p style="font-weight:700">Welcome to our new look! We're still working out some bugs, so let us know if you run across anything that is broken.  </p>
<p>Across Canada, there are hundreds of large and interesting roadside attractions. For almost 20 years, this site has been dedicated to cataloguing our nation’s large roadside attractions. 
<p>We have also included a separate collection that features mainly military and civilian aircraft that are on pedestals: <a href="http://roadsideattractions.ca/pop">planes on sticks</a>. (Unfortunately, this part of the site is temporarily broken, as we transition to our new look.)
<p><a href="mailto:roadsides@roadsideattractions.ca">Send us your photos</a> of any roadside attractions that we have not yet listed. Send us better photos of roadside attractions that we already have. Send us any better info you may have about any of the roadside attractions — including their history and their exact location (GPS coordinates, if you have them). And let us know if any of the roadside attractions are gone and need to be archived.
